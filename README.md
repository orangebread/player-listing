## Notes

Had to use alternative API because it didn't seem like I could get a non-commercial API from mysportsfeed in enough time. Instead I'm pulling data from https://swapi.co/api (a Star Wars API).


Hopefully the spirit of the exercise is conveyed. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
